## Overview

**Veriphi** is an AI-powered system designed for the **automated generation and benchmarking of Verilog RTL code** using large language models (LLMs). This tool evaluates and compares models like Phi-2, StarCoder-2, and CodeGen to produce and verify Verilog code from high-level natural language specifications.

### Why Veriphi?

- **Verilog Code Generation**:  
  Converts natural language design descriptions into syntactically correct Verilog RTL code.

- **LLM Benchmarking**:  
  Compares the performance of multiple fine-tuned language models for Verilog code generation.

- **Automated Verification**:  
  Employs a Verilog test-bench to validate the syntax and functionality of generated code.

- **Flexible Evaluation**:  
  Easily extendable to benchmark additional models or datasets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vamshi-2806/Veriphi.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Veriphi
    ```

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv veriphi_env
    source veriphi_env/bin/activate  # For Windows: veriphi_env\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. **Install required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Open and run the testing notebook:**

    ```bash
    testing.ipynb
    ```

2. **Provide your input prompt describing the desired Verilog design.**

3. **Outputs generated include:**

   - Verilog RTL code generated by various models.
   - Verification results showing syntactic and functional correctness.
   - Benchmark performance metrics of each evaluated LLM.
